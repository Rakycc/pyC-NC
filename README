Implementation of the term extraction algorithm from the 1997 paper "Automatic Term Recognition Using Contextual Cues" by Frantzi et al.
Used to extract a certain percentage of top candidates for terms from a text using termhood and contextual cues.


Use pip for installation: ```pip install git+git://github.com/cartisan/pyC-NC```


To execute the term-extraction: Instantiate the C_NC_TermExtractor class with your text and execute it's compute_cnc method.

```
    extractor = C_NC_TermExtractor(text)
    terms = extractor.compute_cnc()
```
